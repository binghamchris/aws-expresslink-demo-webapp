# AWS IoT ExpressLink and Device Shadow Demo Web App
This repo provides the sample code for the demonstration performed at the AWS User Group meetup in Basel in January 2023. It's intended to work in conjunction with the [CloudFormation and Demo Badge code](https://github.com/binghamchris/aws-expresslink-demo) provided in a separate repo, and requires a physical AWS IoT ExpressLink Demo Badge to work.

## Deployment
This web app is intended to be deployed on AWS Amplify as part of the demo.
Please see the [`deploy/README.md`](https://github.com/binghamchris/aws-expresslink-demo/blob/main/deploy/README.md) file in the main repo for details.
